### Hello there 👋

---

My name is Alejandro Yero Valdes.

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Havana.

My passions are videogames 🎮, playing the guitar 🎸, watching movies 🎥 and programming 🐱‍💻.

My favorite lenguaje is python 🐍, although i really like C# a lot 💙.

I'm really interested in the field of artificial intelligence and hope to work on it in the future.
